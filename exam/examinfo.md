# Examproject info

The exam happens as a project where you have to create a full web application.
More details on what kind of web application you have to build and how the application is graded will be published later.

## Dates

Dates are tentative and *may change*.
You have to give an oral presentation and demo of your project **in person** at the assigned date.
Please plan you travels accordingly.


| Date   |        |              |
| ------ | ------ | ------------ |
| 14.04. | start  |              |
| 01.06. | delivery  | **deadline** 23:59 |
| 10.06. | presentation |  |
| 11.06. | presentation |  |

## Groups:
You are expected to do the project in groups of 2.
You can form groups yourself or ask us to help you form groups.

If you want to work alone, you need a good reason to do so.

## Collaboration requirements:
After forming a group on quickfeed, you will receive a group repository on github.
Use this repository to coordinate your work.
Both group members need to contribute.
As a rule of thumb, you should make at least 30% of the commits.
